# COVID_19_Data_Analytics_PowerBI

Using the COVID 19 data set, I have created a POWER BI dashboard.

I have performed the ETL process by extracting the data from a CSV file, transforming the data (modifying column names and attributes in required format using Power Query Editor) and loaded the data into POWER BI.

Using the created data model, I have created a dashboard organizing the COVID 19 data to understand the COVID 19 impact on each country and how different types of diseases have increased the spread of COVID 19 patients.

With the help of data that has been cleaned and transformed, I made measures and other columns that help to generate a report/dashboard in Power BI using DAX to make data driven decisions.
